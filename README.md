# ANN Classification for Churn Prediction  

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://github.com/sauravbisht17/ANN-classification-churn-prediction)  

This repository contains a project that implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify and predict customer churn. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, and the interactive interface is hosted on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy accessibility and visualization.

## 🔗 Live Demo  

Access the live application here: [Streamlit Cloud Deployment](https://ann-classification-churn-prediction-cnpedhx4jztzaiyzufrznz.streamlit.app/)  

---

## 📁 Repository Contents  

- *Includes datasets used for training and testing the model.  
- Contains the saved ANN model for reuse and testing as pkl file.  
- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit app code that runs the user interface.  
- **`README.md`**: Instructions and details about the project.  
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.  

---

## 💡 Features  

- Predict customer churn probability using an ANN-based model.  
- Simple and interactive web interface with Streamlit.  
- Visualizations of dataset features and model predictions.  
- Easy-to-deploy and extendable codebase.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Make sure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.7 or later  
- Streamlit  
- TensorFlow  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sauravbisht17/ANN-classification-churn-prediction.git
   cd ANN-classification-churn-prediction

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

Access the app at http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

🛠️ How It Works
The model uses customer data to predict churn likelihood.
Input features are preprocessed and fed into the ANN.
The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface to visualize and predict.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, and historical interaction data. It is used to train and evaluate the ANN model for churn prediction.
